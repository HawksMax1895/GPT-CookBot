# Recipe Bot

This Telegram bot processes YouTube cooking videos and generates recipes by leveraging the YouTube Transcript API, OpenAI's GPT-based models, and Notion API. The bot extracts the transcript from the video, processes it, and saves a structured recipe to a connected Notion database.

## Features

- **YouTube URL Parsing**: Automatically extracts the video ID from a YouTube URL.
- **Transcript Retrieval**: Fetches the video transcript using the YouTube Transcript API.
- **Recipe Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate a recipe based on the video transcript.
- **Structured JSON Recipes**: Outputs recipes as JSON objects, including metadata, ingredients, and instructions.
- **Notion Integration**: Saves recipes directly to a Notion database with detailed properties and a formatted structure.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly error messages for invalid URLs, missing transcripts, and non-cooking videos.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.
